            <h1>Eyewear</h1>
            <p>
              Eyewear refers to any type of accessory worn on or around the eyes to enhance vision or protect the eyes. This includes glasses, sunglasses, contact lenses, and goggles. Eyewear can correct vision problems like near sightedness or far sightedness, protect the eyes from harmful UV rays or debris, and improve overall visual acuity. Eyewear can also be a fashion statement, with a wide range of styles, colours, and materials available to suit individual tastes and preferences.

            <p>
              Eyewear is important because it helps protect our eyes from harmful UV radiation, dust, and other pollutants. It also enhances vision and corrects refractive errors such as near sightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism. Additionally, eyewear can be a fashion accessory and a reflection of personal style.

            <h2>FAQs</h2>
            <h4> <strong>Q :</strong> How to know the correct frame shape for my face shape ?</h4>
            <p><strong>A</strong> :
              To determine the best frame shape for your face, start by identifying your face shape. The four main face shapes are round, square, oval, and heart-shaped. Once you know your face shape, choose frames that contrast with your face shape and size, and consider the colour and style that suit your personal taste and lifestyle. It's also helpful to try on different frames to see what looks and feels best while you shop eyewear.
